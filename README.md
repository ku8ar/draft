## üßê Architecture Overview

### üîí Separation of Concerns

- The **React Native Bridge** (inside the framework) is responsible only for rendering UI and handling JS-native communication.
- The **iOS host application** takes full ownership of the network security layer, including **SSL pinning**, request interception, and certificate validation.

This separation ensures that the React Native code does not need to (and cannot) interfere with the security logic.

### üõ°Ô∏è Why This Architecture Is Secure

- All requests from the framework are transparently intercepted by `CustomURLProtocol` using native iOS networking (`NSURLSession`).
- SSL certificate validation and pinning are enforced exclusively by native Swift/Obj-C code in the host app.
- This prevents attackers from bypassing pinning logic by tampering with JavaScript code in the framework.
- The framework is reusable and abstracted, but security policy remains under the host app's control.

### üí° Additional Benefits

- Centralized control allows the host to inject authorization headers, enable network logging, enforce offline modes, or simulate failures.
- The modular design means the framework can be updated or replaced without touching the security-critical code.

---

This architecture offers a robust and clean separation between application logic and security enforcement, making it ideal for enterprise-grade React Native integration.
